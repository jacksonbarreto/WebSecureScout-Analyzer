# WebSecureScout-Analyzer

WebSecureScout Analyzer is a Python and Jupyter-based tool designed to analyze the data generated by WebSecureScout project. This tool will create CSV files containing the analysis results, which can be imported into Excel to generate graphs. In addition to CSV files, the tool will also generate text files containing interpretations of the analysis, which can be used to create reports in Overleaf.

## Usage

+ Clone the WebSecureScout Analyzer repository from Github.
+ Install the required dependencies by running "pip install -r requirements.txt".
+ Copy the CSV files generated by WebSecureScout project into the "data" folder.
+ Open the notebook referring to the analysis you want to perform, such as "security_layer.ipynb", using Jupyter.
+ Run the notebook to generate CSV files and text files with analysis results and interpretations.

Note: Please make sure to follow the instructions carefully to ensure the correct functioning of the tool. And keep in mind that this analyzer only works with data coming from [WebSecureScout](https://github.com/jacksonbarreto/WebSecureScout).
